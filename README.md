# lazy-foo-sdl-rust-adoption
Lazy Foo's course about SDL2, translated to Rust with sdl2 binding library

## Introduction
So before you start a journey, let's talk a litle bit about setup of your environment. First things first, you need to install Rust via rustup, you can download it here on the official website of [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org)
This will also install a Cargo package manager, which will definitely come in handy during the course. At the moment of writing this whole course, i'm at Rust version 1.63.0, i'm also using Windows 11. If you on Linux or on Mac OS, there will be no problem, but carefully read the instructions for installing the necessary dependencies for the [sdl2](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2) crate. I strongly recommend you to read the whole section about installing all needed dependencies before starting your project.

Now, when we done with the setup process, let's talk about the structure of the course.
## Course structure
Well, as you might already understood, course will be splitted into seperate lessons, each lesson will cover the same topic as the one similar to it by number in the course from LazyFoo, but code will be re-written with Rust. Each lesson will have the source code and a small markdown file with some additions, comments and notes. 
## What do I need to study this course?
Uhm, i think that the basic level of Rust will be just enough for you to understand the most of the code (by the basic level, I mean a fully read [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)). I will do my best to avoid using hard parts of Rust, like lifetimes, but if i will have to, i will leave some notes and comments in the attached markdown file.

Also, i want to express my gratitude to [this guy](https://github.com/ysgard) for writting first 18 lessons on the same topic. His work inspired me to update his codebase and to continue this tutorial about Rust and SDL2.
